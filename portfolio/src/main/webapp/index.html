      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Nathaniel Chien, a sophomore at Stanford studying computer science
          with a concentration in biocomputation. I was born and raised in the California
          central valley, but both my parents are immigrants; my mom emigrated from the Philippines
          and my dad from Hong Kong. </p>
      <p>I'm interested in the intersection between computer science and biology, and
          exploring the applications that tech can have in research and healthcare. What 
          draws me to tech is the potential to impact people across the world.</p>
