      <ul>
          <li><b><a href="http://m.culturemesh.com/">Culturemesh: </a></b> I worked on Culturemesh 
          through Code the Change, a club that pairs student developers with nonprofit organizations. 
          The Culturemesh website aims to connect the world's diaspora and help immigrants 
          find their communities in new places. </li><br>
          <li><b><a href="http://35.239.251.24/ENCODE_usability/">Encode Usability Study:</a></b> ENCODE, 
          or the encyclopedia of DNA elements, is a massive database of genetic information, experiments, 
          and sequences. This website was made for the purpose of a usability study to test the effectiveness
          of the current search engine on the ENCODE website, and suggest improvements.</li><br>
